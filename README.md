# Vue Task Tracker
This is a project I built specifically for getting started with and familiarizing myself with Vue.js. I followed along [this](https://youtu.be/qZXt1Aom3Cs) youtube Tutorial, which I highly recommend. 

# Vue Test Tracker

# Description
This app allows people to create and delete tasks. It also allows users to toggle a visual reminder by double-clicking on the task itself. This project uses Vue Router to demonstrate routing between different views (About and Home).
